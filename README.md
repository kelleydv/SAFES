## SAFES

### The Text
I borrowed Barnes' *Statistical Analysis for Engineers and Scientists* from a friend.  Published in 1993, the text came with a floppy disk containing some tools and simulations.  The disk is missing from my copy, and I wouldn't be able to read it anyway.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to infer and recreate the tools on the original floppy disk with the likes of [pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) and [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn), and solve some exercises.

### Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, especially where vectorization can be improved.
